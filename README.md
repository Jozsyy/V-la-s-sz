Welcome! This is the Válas(s)z application. Would you like to play a quiz? You're in the right place! Let's play!

## Introduction
An application that helps people assess their knowledge in various categories of questions, and if they have a good question idea, they can also add it to the application. A quiz contains ten questions, and each question has one correct answer.

## Installation

To connect the Firebase database with Python you need to install pip and then Pyrebase!
Use the folowwing command to install pip and Pyrebase:
```bash
pip install
pip install pyrebase
```
If something goes wrong with installation, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCC3Se6QUE&ab_channel=Codenza)!
